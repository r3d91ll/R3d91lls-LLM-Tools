## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to AI-assisted code generation and evaluation, combining recursive model querying with a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system incorporates advanced context management techniques and leverages specialized models to produce high-quality, secure, and contextually appropriate code by mimicking and extending human code review processes.

## 2. System Overview

The system consists of several key components:

1. A large language model (LLM) capable of code generation and analysis
2. A graph vector store for RAG, containing project-specific knowledge and code context
3. Multiple specialized models for different aspects of code evaluation
4. An advanced context management system using shared and individual scratchpads
5. A flexible model selection and rotation mechanism

The system operates through multiple recursive evaluation loops, each focusing on a specific aspect of code quality. It leverages the graph RAG system to provide relevant context at each stage, enhancing the model's understanding of project-specific requirements and best practices.

## 3. Recursive Evaluation Loops

The system employs six primary evaluation loops, each designed to focus on a specific aspect of code quality:

### 3.1 Syntax and Import Check (Loop 1)

- Identifies syntax errors
- Checks for missing or unnecessary imports
- Ensures proper indentation and code structure

### 3.2 Logic and Unit Testing (Loop 2)

- Analyzes the logic flow
- Generates and simulates running unit tests
- Compares output against the intended objective
- Identifies edge cases and potential logical errors

### 3.3 Code Integration (Loop 3)

- Evaluates how the new code fits into the existing codebase
- Checks for naming conventions and consistency with project standards
- Identifies potential conflicts or redundancies with existing code

### 3.4 Security Audit (Loop 4)

- Looks for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
- Checks for proper input validation and sanitization
- Identifies potential data exposure or unauthorized access points

### 3.5 Performance Optimization (Loop 5)

- Analyzes time and space complexity
- Suggests optimizations for resource-intensive operations
- Recommends more efficient data structures or algorithms if applicable

### 3.6 Documentation and Readability (Loop 6)

- Ensures proper commenting and docstrings
- Evaluates overall code readability
- Suggests improvements for variable/function naming

## 4. Graph RAG Integration

The graph vector store RAG system is crucial for providing context and project-specific information. It is utilized in the following ways:

### 4.1 Context Retrieval

Before each evaluation loop, the system queries the graph store for relevant context, including:

- Project coding standards
- Related functions or classes
- Known issues in similar code
- Historical changes and their rationales

### 4.2 Knowledge Augmentation

The retrieved information is used to augment the prompts for each evaluation loop, making them more specific and contextually relevant.

### 4.3 Codebase Understanding

The graph structure helps the model understand relationships between different parts of the codebase, improving the integration evaluation.

### 4.4 Historical Analysis

If the graph store includes version history, it can inform the model about past issues or improvements made to similar code.

### 4.5 Security Pattern Recognition

Known security patterns and anti-patterns stored in the graph enhance the security audit loop.

### 4.6 Performance Benchmarks

Performance metrics of existing code stored in the graph provide benchmarks for the optimization loop.

## 5. Enhanced Context Management

The system implements an advanced context management approach using shared and individual scratchpads:

### 5.1 Shared Scratchpad

- Location: Server RAM
- Purpose: Store and share global context and intermediate results accessible to all models
- Content:
  - Overall code state
  - High-level evaluation summaries
  - Cross-task relevant information

### 5.2 Individual Scratchpads

- Location: Server RAM, allocated per model
- Purpose: Store task-specific context and temporary calculations
- Content:
  - Task-specific evaluation details
  - Intermediate computations
  - Model-specific metadata

### 5.3 Context Flow Management

- Sequential Context Passing: Results and relevant context from one model are efficiently passed to the next in the evaluation pipeline.
- Parallel Context Processing: Different aspects of the code can be evaluated simultaneously with their own specialized contexts.
- Context Prioritization: The system prioritizes certain types of context for different evaluation tasks.
- Adaptive Context Refresh: The system selectively refreshes parts of the context as the code evolves through the evaluation process.

## 6. Specialized Models and Model Diversity

The system incorporates multiple specialized models and a model rotation system:

### 6.1 Model Specialization

- Syntax and Import Specialist
- Logic and Testing Expert
- Integration Analyst
- Security Auditor
- Performance Optimizer
- Documentation and Readability Enhancer

### 6.2 Model Rotation and Diversity

- Model Pools: For each specialized task, maintain a pool of qualified models.
- Dynamic Selection: Randomly or systematically select models from the pool for each evaluation loop.
- Role Rotation: Periodically rotate models between different roles to introduce fresh perspectives.

## 7. Implementation
