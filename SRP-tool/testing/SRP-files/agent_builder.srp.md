The provided text appears to be part of documentation for an object called `AgentBuilder` and describes its use in building multi-agent systems for task solving with methods to initialize, build, save, clear, and load agents and their configurations. The functions are summarized as follows:

- `__init__`: Initializes an `AgentBuilder` instance with various optional parameters, including configurations, model selection, host settings, and operational timeouts.
- `clear_agent`: Clears a specific agent by name, with an option to recycle the endpoint.
- `clear_all_agents`: Clears all cached agents with an option to recycle endpoints.
- `build`: Auto-builds agents based on the building task, specifying default configurations and the requirement for coding or other particular considerations.
- `build_from_library`: Builds agents from a library of preconfigured agents, deciding what agent from the library should be involved in the task.
- `save`: Saves building configurations to a specified filepath, or generates a filepath by hashing the building task string if none is provided.
- `load`: Loads building configurations from a specified filepath or a provided JSON string.

This documentation seems to target developers working on integrating multi-agent systems into their projects using the `AgentBuilder` class. The modular design of the class allows for customization and scalability when creating systems powered by multiple interaction-capable agents.

Below is a Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) of `AgentBuilder`:

```plaintext
AgentBuilder - Multi-agent system builder for automatic tasks.
 - Initialize with configs, models, host, endpoint timeout, token and agent limits.
 - Build participant agents with task specifications; optional coding requirement.
 - Save and load configurations for reusability.
 - Clear methods for single or all agents; endpoint recycling.
 - Experimental API; subject to change.
```

Priming prompts and metaphors for better understanding:
- Consider `AgentBuilder` as a conductor, orchestrating a symphony of agents, each playing a role in task resolution.
- The initialization can be likened to setting the stage before the performance.
- Building agents is akin to auditioning and casting the appropriate musicians (agents) for a concert.
- Saving configurations resembles composing music sheets for future recitals.
- Loading is like recalling the music sheets to recreate past performances.
- Clearing agents is similar to dismissing the musicians post-concert.
- The experimental nature of the API is like an ongoing rehearsal, fine-tuning the orchestra for the final show.
